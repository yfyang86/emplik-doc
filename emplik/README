This package is based on R code el.cen.EM, el.cen.EM2,
el.trun.test emplikH1, emplikH2, emplikdisc.test and 
el.cen.test, etc. written by Mai Zhou. 

The code el.test is ported from S code ELM() by Art Owen. 
el.test() can handle vector means as null hypothesis (several
mean parameters), but data must be uncensored. 
When dealing with censored data, use el.cen.EM2() to handle 
vector means.

Many other code in this package can only handle one parameter in H0.
But that parameter(s) can be mean/hazard/quantile, and the
function can also take censored/truncated data as inputs.
 
The name convention: el.xxx     for the parameter of mean(s).
                     emplikxxx  for the parameter of hazard(s).

Add function findLnew(), findUnew(). 6/2022.

Add function el.cen.kmc1d() in version 1.1-2, which is much faster
than el.cen.EM(). But it sometimes fail to find the right answer.

To do list:  

Speed up with solve(A,b) instead of finding the
full inverse matrix by svd and compute A{-1}*b . 
See emplikH2.test2() for an example.

Integrate the kmc package into emplik package.
