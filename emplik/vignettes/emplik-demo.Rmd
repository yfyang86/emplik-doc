# Title: Demo, styles, refeneces, tables, formulas, R code

The Kaplan–Meier curve and the namesake Kaplan–Meier 1958 paper is the most cited statistical paper in the history. We study the error analysis of the popular Kaplan–Meier curve. We describe in detail and recommend a method based on the calculation of constrained Kaplan–Meier curve and the recently developed Empirical Likelihood theory.

An example of K-M and tilted K-M curve is illustrated in Figure 1.

If no caption is needed, then `![figure](figure_path)` could represent the figure.


## Section: Formulas

This program uses EM algorithm to compute the maximized (wrt $p_i$) empirical log likelihood function for right, left or doubly censored data with the MEAN constraint:

$$sum_{d_i=1}  p_i f(x_i)  = \int f(t) dF(t) = mu .$$

Where $p_i = \Delta F(x_i)$ is a probability, $d_i$ is the censoring indicator, 1(uncensored), 0(right censored), 2(left censored). It also returns those $p_i$.

The empirical log likelihood been maximized is

$$sum_{d_i=1} \log Delta F(x_i) + sum_{d_i=0} \log [1-F(x_i)] + sum_{d_i=2}  \log F(x_i) .$$

```{r results = 'asis'}
## example with tied observations
library(emplik)
library(knitr)
x <- c(1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 5, 4, 1, 2, 4.5)
d <- c(1,   1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0,   1)
result <- el.cen.EM(x,d,mu=3.5)
plot(result$times, 1.- cumsum(result$prob), type='b', xlab = 'time', ylab = 'prob', main='Surv Prob')
dt1 <- data.frame(Time = result$times, Prob = result$prob)
kable(dt1, caption = "Example1: Simple constriant MLE")
print(result)
```

One could enable `echo = FALSE or TRUE` per need (options are seperated by `,`).
